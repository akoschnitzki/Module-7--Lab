# Module-7--Lab



Hello World,

Alex here, I am going to talk to you about the lab assignment that I had to complete. In 
each of the differnt questions, they all are able to use the function method to be able to 
complete the questions. In each of the different questions, they can be able to have a different 
number in the code and they will still be able to run the way they are supposed to run. The function
method is important to be able to help with any code. 

From Alex.
